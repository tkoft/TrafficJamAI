# CSCI373 Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2016)
## Project 1, (c) 2016 Gary Chen

The solution to this project includes three python modules:
  - `JamPuzzle.py`, a module for creating instances of the Traffic Jam Puzzle
  - `JamAgent.py`, a module for running an AI BFS-search algorithm on Traffic Jam Puzzles
  - `test.py`, a script that tests this solution on the three example puzzles

To run the solution, make sure all three modules are in the same directory.  Then, running `python3 test.py` will create the three example puzzles and run the AI search algorithm on each, printing the resulting series of moves that solve each puzzle step-by-step.  On my own consumer-grade laptop, this program completes all three puzzles in under 30 seconds.

The test script `test.py` can be modified to include more puzzles if so desired.
